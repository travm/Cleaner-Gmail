Cleaner Gmail
=============

The Cleaner Gmail Chrome extension is created to simplify, correct, and remove certain elements of the Gmail interface while remaining very flexible, efficient and respectful to the official Gmail design.

Using only CSS, this extension can efficiently modify Gmail interface elements so that you experience no unnecessary load or weight on your browser.

All of the Gmail themes will work with this extension. However, the Bus Stop theme tends to make things a little ugly with or without this extension. So, I would stay away from that one if I were you!

## v2.0 CHANGES

- Code clean up and removal of redundant classes. With the launch of Google+ the Gmail team added some improvements to Gmail. Several of them were elements that I corrected with this extension. So, now that they officially implemented similar changes I've removed those items from my code to avoid conflicts.

## v1.9 CHANGES:

- Resized the chat window header. It now matches the tasks window header so they are flush against the bottom when collapsed.
- Removal of "Search The Web" button.
- Footer information is centered again and now semi-transparent. On hover, will become opaque.
- Added polish to the added buttons from v1.7 (Newer/Older, Back To Inbox). They look and act even more like the standard Gmail buttons!
- Fixed unwanted bleeding of styles to avoid accidentally styling extra elements.

## v1.8 CHANGES:

- Removal of user's name in expanded chat widget.
- Removal of hidden graphic beside the status box in the chat widget.
- Chat widget spacing changes.
- Removal of footer tips.
- Footer information spacing has been modified & is left aligned instead of center aligned.
- Removal of "Invite a Friend" widget.
- "Older/Newer" and "Back To Inbox" links appear as buttons, instead of plain text.

__Note:__ This extension is quite dated. Luckily Gmail has since improved on most of the issues that this extension was created to fix!
